/**
 * What an explainer examined, and what it did not.
 *
 * A review is bounded by its diff, so its own scope is the reader's proof that
 * nothing was skipped. A codebase has no such bound: prose over a whole repo
 * either runs unreadably long or quietly leaves most of the system out, and an
 * explanation that leaves things out silently is misleading about architecture.
 *
 * So coverage is DERIVED here rather than claimed in prose. Every file at the
 * pinned commit inside the scope is accounted for, in one of three states, and
 * the reader is shown the ones the document never touched. Everything on this
 * record is a count or a list of named things at that commit: the reader can
 * re-derive any of it with `thurview graph architecture`. Nothing here grades
 * the code - no scores, no thresholds, no severity. Where a number invites a
 * conclusion, drawing it is the reader's job.
