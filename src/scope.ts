/**
 * The declared review scope: which paths of the repository under review a
 * thurview document is allowed to read.
 *
 * Without one, every route that takes a path reads it at a pinned commit and
 * nothing enumerates what is reviewable, so a `.env`, a keystore or a generated
 * blob committed at either pin is served in full to whoever can reach the
 * server. The scope inverts that default: a path is readable only because the
 * repository said so.
 *
 * Three things follow from where the rules live and what they are for.
 *
 * **The rules are an allowlist, not an ignore list.** An ignore list covers the
 * file types someone remembered; an allowlist makes an unexpected file fail by
 * absence. That is the property that does the work, so `extensions` and
 * `filenames` are what a path must match, and `exclude` only narrows further.
 *
 * **`filenames` is a list of its own beside `extensions`,** because thurview is
 * language-agnostic: `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `Jenkinsfile` and a dotfile whose
 * entire name is its suffix have no extension to allow.
 *
 * **`exclude` matches from the first segment of the path, never at any segment.**
 * `src/generated` excludes `src/generated/**` and leaves `lib/src/generated/**`
 * alone. Any-segment matching is right for a tool's own list of build output -
 * `graph.ts`'s SKIP says why it keeps it - and wrong for a rule a person wrote,
 * where "any segment named `test`" silently drops a package whose own name ends
 * in `test`. An entry may hold a glob, and it is still anchored at the first
 * segment: `*` is one segment, so a `*` then `test` is the `test` directory of
 * every top-level module, and reaching any depth takes a `**` somebody wrote.
 *
 * The rules are read from the repository under review, at the pinned head
 * commit, which means the change request being reviewed can edit them. That is
 * deliberate and it is visible in the diff, but it bounds what this is: a
 * control against putting the wrong file in front of a reviewer by accident,
 * not a boundary that holds against an author who does not want it to.
